A leading ride-hailing company is experiencing significant operational inefficiencies, with drivers facing considerable idle time and customers experiencing extended wait times due to suboptimal cab allocation across service regions. The current manual resource allocation system fails to effectively account for dynamic factors such as time-based demand variations and historical booking patterns across different months, impacting both revenue potential and customer satisfaction. The company needs a data-driven solution that can accurately predict demand patterns across different regions using monthly historical booking data and automatically optimize cab allocation to minimize idle time and improve customer satisfaction while maximizing revenue potential. This solution must be scalable across all operational regions, comply with data privacy regulations, and integrate with existing dispatch systems while providing real-time optimization capabilities.
